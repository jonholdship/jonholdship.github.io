        As a postdoc at Leiden Observatory, I do research centred around the application of machine learning to Astrochemistry as part of {" "}
        <a href="https://moppex.github.io">
          the MOPPEX project
        </a>{" "}
        . The ultimate goal of which is to produce a single tool which can be used to infer important physical parameters of galaxies from molecular observations.
        <br />
        <br />
        As a researcher, I'm interested in the use of astrochemical models to interpret observations and improve hydrodynamical simulations. I'm particularly interested in
         the use of Bayesian inference to provide some rigour to this process as well as machine learning to help us overcome computational hurdles.

        Concurrently with my Astrophysics PDRA position, I work as a data scientist at a major London hospital trust. My role includes 
        liasing with clinicians and other stakeholders to determine how our analytics team can best achieve their goals, building machine learning
        models where appropriate, and mentoring junior analysts.
        <br />
        <br />
        There are many areas in medicine where knowing something ahead of time would be of immense use. Whether its alerting clinicians to patients
        who are likely to suffer from something which can go under the radar such as septic shock in paediatric infection cases or highlighting patients
        who may need specialist care, machine learning can be used to reduce the number of missed opportunities for care and to make hospitals run more efficiently.

        After my first PDRA position, I obtained funding for a six month fellowship funded by <a href="https://dirac.ac.uk/">DiRAC</a>. During this time,
        I was effectively a data scientist as Guy's and St Thomas'. I worked on proof of concept models, predicting the likelihood of a patient attending their
        scheduled outpatient appointments in order to demonstrate the usefulness of big data techniques in a hospital setting.

        I spent three years as a PhD student at UCL, developing <a href="https://uclchem.github.io">an astrochemical model</a> and applying it
        to interpret observations of the L1157 outflow. During this time, I published four first author papers and was awarded the Jon Darius Memorial Prize
        for outstanding postgraduate research in Astrophysics.

       I completed my undergraduate degree in Physics at Imperial College London. My MSci project was a data reduction project, reducing Near IR photometric data
       in order to search for lyman alpha drop outs which could be followed up in order to ascertain whether they were high redshift galaxies.
